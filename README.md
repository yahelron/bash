   </tr>
</table>

### a. `awk`
awk is the most useful command for handling text files. It operates on an entire file line by line. By default it uses whitespace to separate the fields. The most common syntax for awk command is

```bash
awk '/search_pattern/ { action_to_take_if_pattern_matches; }' file_to_parse
```

Lets take following file `/etc/passwd`. Here's the sample data that this file contains:
```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/zsh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
```
So now lets get only username from this file. Where `-F` specifies that on which base we are going to separate the fields. In our case it's `:`. `{ print $1 }` means print out the first matching field.
```bash
awk -F':' '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd
```
After running the above command you will get following output.
```
root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
```
For more detail on how to use `awk`, check following [link](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-scripting-using-awk).


### b. `cut`

diam voluptua. At
vero eos et
accusam et justo
duo dolores et ea
rebum. Stet clita

_krb_kadmin:*:231:-2:Open Directory Kerberos Admin Service:/var/empty:/usr/bin/false
```
You can also force grep to ignore word case by using `-i` option. `-r` can be used to search all files under the specified directory, for example:
```bash
$ grep -r admin /etc/

# Introduction

If you are a developer, then you know the value of time. Optimizing your work process is one of the most important aspects of the job.

In that path towards efficiency and productivity, we are often posed with actions that must be repeated over and over again, like:

* taking a screenshot and uploading it to a server
* processing text that may come in many shapes and forms
* converting files between different formats
* parsing a program's output

Enter **Bash**, our savior.

Bash is a Unix shell written by [Brian Fox][] for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell). It was released in 1989 and has been distributed as the Linux and macOS default shell for a long time.

[Brian Fox]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)
<!-- link this format, because some MD processors handle '()' in URLs poorly -->

So why do we need to learn something that was written more than 30 years ago? The answer is simple: this _something_ is today one of the most powerful and portable tools for writing efficient scripts for all Unix-based systems. And that's why you should learn bash. Period.

In this handbook, I'm going to describe the most important concepts in bash with examples. I hope this compendium will be helpful to you.

# Shells and modes

The user bash shell can work in two modes - interactive and non-interactive.

## Interactive mode

If you are working on Ubuntu, you have seven virtual terminals available to you.
The desktop environment takes place in the seventh virtual terminal, so you can return to a friendly GUI
using the `Ctrl-Alt-F7` keybinding.

You can open the shell using the `Ctrl-Alt-F1` keybinding. After that, the familiar GUI will disappear and one of the virtual terminals will be shown.

If you see something like this, then you are working in interactive mode:

    user@host:~$

Here you can enter a variety of Unix commands, such as `ls`, `grep`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm` and see the result of their execution.

We call this shell interactive because it interacts directly with the user.

Using a virtual terminal is not really convenient. For example, if you want to edit a document and execute another command at the same time, you are better off using virtual terminal emulators like:

- [GNOME Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal)
- [Terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(terminal_emulator))
- [iTerm2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITerm2)
- [ConEmu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConEmu)

## Non-interactive mode

In non-interactive mode, the shell reads commands from a file or a pipe and executes them. When the interpreter reaches the end of the file, the shell process terminates the session and returns to the parent process.

Use the following commands for running the shell in non-interactive mode:

    sh /path/to/script.sh
    bash /path/to/script.sh

In the example above, `script.sh` is just a regular text file that consists of commands the shell interpreter can evaluate and `sh` or `bash` is the shell's interpreter program. You can create `script.sh` using your preferred text editor (e.g. vim, nano, Sublime Text, Atom, etc).

You can also simplify invoking the script by making it an executable file using the `chmod` command:


    chmod +x /path/to/script.sh

Additionally, the first line in the script must indicate which program it should use to run the file, like so:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Or if you prefer to use `sh` instead of `bash`, change `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/bin/sh`. This `#!` character sequence is known as the [shebang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29). Now you can run the script like this:

    /path/to/script.sh

A handy trick we used above is using `echo` to print text to the terminal screen.

Another way to use the shebang line is as follows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

The advantage of this shebang line is it will search for the program (in this case `bash`) based on the `PATH` environment variable. This is often preferred over the first method shown above, as the location of a program on a filesystem cannot always be assumed. This is also useful if the `PATH` variable on a system has been configured to point to an alternate version of the program. For instance, one might install a newer version of `bash` while preserving the original version and insert the location of the newer version into the `PATH` variable. The use of `#!/bin/bash` would result in using the original `bash`, while `#!/usr/bin/env bash` would make use of the newer version.


## Exit codes

Every command returns an **exit code** (**return status** or **exit status**). A successful command always returns `0` (zero-code), and a command that has failed returns a non-zero value (error code). Failure codes must be positive integers between 1 and 255.

Another handy command we can use when writing a script is `exit`. This command is used to terminate the current execution and deliver an exit code to the shell. Running an `exit` code without any arguments, will terminate the running script and return the exit code of the last command executed before `exit`.

When a program terminates, the shell assigns its **exit code** to the `$?` environment variable. The `$?` variable is how we usually test whether a script has succeeded or not in its execution.

In the same way we can use `exit` to terminate a script, we can use the `return` command to exit a function and return an **exit code** to the caller. You can use `exit` inside a function too and this will exit the function _and_ terminate the program.

# Comments

Scripts may contain _comments_. Comments are special statements ignored by the `shell` interpreter. They begin with a `#` symbol and continue on to the end of the line.

For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script will print your username.
whoami
```

> **Tip**: Use comments to explain what your script does and _why_.

# Variables

Like in most programming languages, you can also create variables in bash.

Bash knows no data types. Variables can contain only numbers or a string of one or more characters. There are three kinds of variables you can create: local variables, environment variables and variables as _positional arguments_.

## Local variables

**Local variables** are variables that exist only within a single script. They are inaccessible to other programs and scripts.

A local variable can be declared using `=` sign (as a rule, there **should not** be any spaces between a variable's name, `=` and its value) and its value can be retrieved using the `$` sign. For example:

```bash
username="denysdovhan"  # declare variable
echo $username          # display value
unset username          # delete variable
```

We can also declare a variable local to a single function using the `local` keyword. Doing so causes the variable to disappear when the function exits.

```bash
local local_var="I'm a local value"
```

## Environment variables

**Environment variables** are variables accessible to any program or script running in current shell session. They are created just like local variables, but using the keyword `export` instead.

```bash
export GLOBAL_VAR="I'm a global variable"
```

There are _a lot_ of global variables in bash. You will meet these variables fairly often, so here is a quick lookup table with the most practical ones:

| Variable     | Description                                                   |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$HOME`      | The current user's home directory.                            |
| `$PATH`      | A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands. |
| `$PWD`       | The current working directory.                                |
| `$RANDOM`    | Random integer between 0 and 32767.                           |
| `$UID`       | The numeric, real user ID of the current user.                |
| `$PS1`       | The primary prompt string.                                    |
| `$PS2`       | The secondary prompt string.                                  |

## Positional parameters

**Positional parameters** are variables allocated when a function is evaluated and are given positionally. The following table lists positional parameter variables and other special variables and their meanings when you are inside a function.

| Parameter      | Description                                                 |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$0`           | Script's name.                                              |
| `$1 … $9`      | The parameter list elements from 1 to 9.                     |
| `${10} … ${N}` | The parameter list elements from 10 to N.                    |
| `$*` or `$@`   | All positional parameters except `$0`.                      |
| `$#`           | The number of parameters, not counting `$0`.                 |
| `$FUNCNAME`    | The function name (has a value only inside a function).     |

In the example below, the positional parameters will be `$0='./script.sh'`,  `$1='foo'` and `$2='bar'`:

    ./script.sh foo bar

Variables may also have _default_ values. We can define as such using the following syntax:

```bash
 # if variables are empty, assign them default values
: ${VAR:='default'}
: ${$1:='first'}
# or
FOO=${FOO:-'default'}
```

# Shell expansions

_Expansions_ are performed on the command line after it has been split into _tokens_. In other words, these expansions are a mechanism to calculate arithmetical operations, to save results of commands' executions and so on.

If you are interested, you can read [more about shell expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Expansions).

## Brace expansion

Brace expansion allows us to generate arbitrary strings. It's similar to _filename expansion_. For example:

```bash
echo beg{i,a,u}n # begin began begun
```

Also brace expansions may be used for creating ranges, which are iterated over in loops.

```bash
echo {0..5} # 0 1 2 3 4 5
echo {00..8..2} # 00 02 04 06 08
```

## Command substitution

Command substitution allow us to evaluate a command and substitute its value into another command or variable assignment. Command substitution is performed when a command is enclosed by ``` `` ``` or `$()`.  For example, we can use it as follows:

```bash
now=`date +%T`
# or
now=$(date +%T)

echo $now # 19:08:26
```

## Arithmetic expansion

In bash we are free to do any arithmetical operations. But the expression must enclosed by `$(( ))` The format for arithmetic expansions is:

```bash
result=$(( ((10 + 5*3) - 7) / 2 ))
echo $result # 9
```

Within arithmetic expansions, variables should generally be used without a `$` prefix:

```bash
x=4
y=7
echo $(( x + y ))     # 11
echo $(( ++x + y++ )) # 12
echo $(( x + y ))     # 13
```

## Double and single quotes

There is an important difference between double and single quotes. Inside double quotes variables or command substitutions are expanded. Inside single quotes they are not. For example:

```bash
echo "Your home: $HOME" # Your home: /Users/<username>
echo 'Your home: $HOME' # Your home: $HOME
```

Take care to expand local variables and environment variables within quotes if they could contain whitespace. As an innocuous example, consider using `echo` to print some user input:

```bash
INPUT="A string  with   strange    whitespace."
echo $INPUT   # A string with strange whitespace.
echo "$INPUT" # A string  with   strange    whitespace.
```

The first `echo` is invoked with 5 separate arguments — $INPUT is split into separate words, `echo` prints a single space character between each. In the second case, `echo` is invoked with a single argument (the entire $INPUT value, including whitespace).

Now consider a more serious example:

```bash
FILE="Favorite Things.txt"
cat $FILE   # attempts to print 2 files: `Favorite` and `Things.txt`
cat "$FILE" # prints 1 file: `Favorite Things.txt`
```

While the issue in this example could be resolved by renaming FILE to `Favorite-Things.txt`, consider input coming from an environment variable, a positional parameter, or the output of another command (`find`, `cat`, etc). If the input *might* contain whitespace, take care to wrap the expansion in quotes.

# Arrays

Like in other programming languages, an array in bash is a variable that allows you to refer to multiple values. In bash, arrays are also zero-based, that is, the first element in an array has index 0.

When dealing with arrays, we should be aware of the special environment variable `IFS`. **IFS**, or **Input Field Separator**, is the character that separates elements in an array. The default value is an empty space `IFS=' '`.

## Array declaration

In bash you create an array by simply assigning a value to an index in the array variable:

```bash
fruits[0]=Apple
fruits[1]=Pear
fruits[2]=Plum
```

Array variables can also be created using compound assignments such as:

```bash
fruits=(Apple Pear Plum)
```

## Array expansion

Individual array elements are expanded similar to other variables:

```bash
echo ${fruits[1]} # Pear
```

The entire array can be expanded by using `*` or `@` in place of the numeric index:

```bash
echo ${fruits[*]} # Apple Pear Plum
echo ${fruits[@]} # Apple Pear Plum
```

There is an important (and subtle) difference between the two lines above: consider an array element containing whitespace:

```bash
fruits[0]=Apple
fruits[1]="Desert fig"
fruits[2]=Plum
```

We want to print each element of the array on a separate line, so we try to use the `printf` builtin:

```bash
printf "+ %s\n" ${fruits[*]}
# + Apple
# + Desert
# + fig
# + Plum
```

Why were `Desert` and `fig` printed on separate lines? Let's try to use quoting:

```bash
printf "+ %s\n" "${fruits[*]}"
# + Apple Desert fig Plum
```

Now everything is on one line — that's not what we wanted! Here's where `${fruits[@]}` comes into play:

```bash
printf "+ %s\n" "${fruits[@]}"
# + Apple
# + Desert fig
# + Plum
```

Within double quotes, `${fruits[@]}` expands to a separate argument for each element in the array; whitespace in the array elements is preserved.

## Array slice

Besides, we can extract a slice of array using the _slice_ operators:

```bash
echo ${fruits[@]:0:2} # Apple Desert fig
```

In the example above, `${fruits[@]}` expands to the entire contents of the array, and `:0:2` extracts the slice of length 2, that starts at index 0.

## Adding elements into an array

Adding elements into an array is quite simple too. Compound assignments are specially useful in this case. We can use them like this:

```bash
fruits=(Orange "${fruits[@]}" Banana Cherry)
echo ${fruits[@]} # Orange Apple Desert fig Plum Banana Cherry
```

The example above, `${fruits[@]}` expands to the entire contents of the array and substitutes it into the compound assignment, then assigns the new value into the `fruits` array mutating its original value.

## Deleting elements from an array

To delete an element from an array, use the `unset` command:

```bash
unset fruits[0]
echo ${fruits[@]} # Apple Desert fig Plum Banana Cherry
```

# Streams, pipes and lists

Bash has powerful tools for working with other programs and their outputs. Using streams we can send the output of a program into another program or file and thereby write logs or whatever we want.

Pipes give us opportunity to create conveyors and control the execution of commands.

It is paramount we understand how to use this powerful and sophisticated tool.

## Streams

Bash receives input and sends output as sequences or **streams** of characters. These streams may be redirected into files or one into another.

There are three descriptors:

| Code | Descriptor | Description          |
| :--: | :--------: | :------------------- |
| `0`  | `stdin`    | The standard input.  |
| `1`  | `stdout`   | The standard output. |
| `2`  | `stderr`   | The errors output.   |

Redirection makes it possible to control where the output of a command goes to, and where the input of a command comes from. For redirecting streams these operators are used:

| Operator | Description                                  |
| :------: | :------------------------------------------- |
| `>`      | Redirecting output                           |
| `&>`     | Redirecting output and error output          |
| `&>>`    | Appending redirected output and error output |
| `<`      | Redirecting input                            |
| `<<`     | [Here documents](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) syntax |
| `<<<`    | [Here strings](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x17837.html) |

Here are few examples of using redirections:

```bash
# output of ls will be written to list.txt
ls -l > list.txt

# append output to list.txt
ls -a >> list.txt

# all errors will be written to errors.txt
grep da * 2> errors.txt

# read from errors.txt
less < errors.txt
```

## Pipes

We could redirect standard streams not only in files, but also to other programs. **Pipes** let us use the output of a program as the input of another.

In the example below, `command1` sends its output to `command2`, which then passes it on to the input of `command3`:

    command1 | command2 | command3

Constructions like this are called **pipelines**.

In practice, this can be used to process data through several programs. For example, here the output of `ls -l` is sent to the `grep` program, which  prints only files with a `.md` extension, and this output is finally sent to the `less` program:

    ls -l | grep .md$ | less

The exit status of a pipeline is normally the exit status of the last command in the pipeline. The shell will not return a status until all the commands in the pipeline have completed. If you want your pipelines to be considered a failure if any of the commands in the pipeline fail, you should set the pipefail option with:

    set -o pipefail

## Lists of commands

A **list of commands** is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by `;`, `&`, `&&` or `||` operator.

If a command is terminated by the control operator `&`, the shell executes the command asynchronously in a subshell. In other words, this command will be executed in the background.

Commands separated by a `;` are executed sequentially: one after another. The shell waits for the finish of each command.

```bash
# command2 will be executed after command1
command1 ; command2

# which is the same as
command1
command2
```

Lists separated by `&&` and `||` are called _AND_ and _OR_ lists, respectively.

The _AND-list_ looks like this:

```bash
# command2 will be executed if, and only if, command1 finishes successfully (returns 0 exit status)
command1 && command2
```

The _OR-list_ has the form:

```bash
# command2 will be executed if, and only if, command1 finishes unsuccessfully (returns code of error)
command1 || command2
```

The return code of an _AND_ or _OR_ list is the exit status of the last executed command.

# Conditional statements

Like in other languages, Bash conditionals let us decide to perform an action or not.  The result is determined by evaluating an expression, which should be enclosed in `[[ ]]`.

Conditional expression may contain `&&` and `||` operators, which are _AND_ and _OR_ accordingly. Besides this, there many [other handy expressions](#primary-and-combining-expressions).

There are two different conditional statements: `if` statement and `case` statement.

## Primary and combining expressions

Expressions enclosed inside `[[ ]]` (or `[ ]` for `sh`) are called **test commands** or **primaries**. These expressions help us to indicate results of a conditional. In the tables below, we are using `[ ]`, because it works for `sh` too. Here is an answer about [the difference between double and single square brackets in bash](http://serverfault.com/a/52050).

**Working with the file system:**

| Primary       | Meaning                                                      |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[ -e FILE ]` | True if `FILE` **e**xists.                                   |
| `[ -f FILE ]` | True if `FILE` exists and is a regular **f**ile.             |
| `[ -d FILE ]` | True if `FILE` exists and is a **d**irectory.                |
| `[ -s FILE ]` | True if `FILE` exists and not empty (**s**ize more than 0).  |
| `[ -r FILE ]` | True if `FILE` exists and is **r**eadable.                   |
| `[ -w FILE ]` | True if `FILE` exists and is **w**ritable.                   |
| `[ -x FILE ]` | True if `FILE` exists and is e**x**ecutable.                 |
| `[ -L FILE ]` | True if `FILE` exists and is symbolic **l**ink.              |
| `[ FILE1 -nt FILE2 ]` | FILE1 is **n**ewer **t**han FILE2.                   |
| `[ FILE1 -ot FILE2 ]` | FILE1 is **o**lder **t**han FILE2.                   |

**Working with strings:**

| Primary        | Meaning                                                     |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[ -z STR ]`   | `STR` is empty (the length is **z**ero).                    |
| `[ -n STR ]`   |`STR` is not empty (the length is **n**on-zero).             |
| `[ STR1 == STR2 ]` | `STR1` and `STR2` are equal.                            |
| `[ STR1 != STR2 ]` | `STR1` and `STR2` are not equal.                        |

**Arithmetic binary operators:**

| Primary             | Meaning                                                |
| :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `[ ARG1 -eq ARG2 ]` | `ARG1` is **eq**ual to `ARG2`.                         |
| `[ ARG1 -ne ARG2 ]` | `ARG1` is **n**ot **e**qual to `ARG2`.                 |
| `[ ARG1 -lt ARG2 ]` | `ARG1` is **l**ess **t**han `ARG2`.                    |
| `[ ARG1 -le ARG2 ]` | `ARG1` is **l**ess than or **e**qual to `ARG2`.        |
| `[ ARG1 -gt ARG2 ]` | `ARG1` is **g**reater **t**han `ARG2`.                 |
| `[ ARG1 -ge ARG2 ]` | `ARG1` is **g**reater than or **e**qual to `ARG2`.     |

Conditions may be combined using these **combining expressions:**

| Operation      | Effect                                                      |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[ ! EXPR ]`   | True if `EXPR` is false.                                    |
| `[ (EXPR) ]`   | Returns the value of `EXPR`.                                |
| `[ EXPR1 -a EXPR2 ]` | Logical _AND_. True if `EXPR1` **a**nd `EXPR2` are true. |
| `[ EXPR1 -o EXPR2 ]` | Logical _OR_. True if `EXPR1` **o**r `EXPR2` are true.|

Sure, there are more useful primaries and you can easily find them in the [Bash man pages](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html).

## Using an `if` statement

`if` statements work the same as in other programming languages. If the expression within the braces is true, the code between `then` and `fi` is executed.  `fi` indicates the end of the conditionally executed code.

```bash
# Single-line
if [[ 1 -eq 1 ]]; then echo "true"; fi

# Multi-line
if [[ 1 -eq 1 ]]; then
  echo "true"
fi
```

Likewise, we could use an `if..else` statement such as:

```bash
# Single-line
if [[ 2 -ne 1 ]]; then echo "true"; else echo "false"; fi

# Multi-line
if [[ 2 -ne 1 ]]; then
  echo "true"
else
  echo "false"
fi
```

Sometimes `if..else` statements are not enough to do what we want to do. In this case we shouldn't forget about the existence of `if..elif..else` statements, which always come in handy.

Look at the example below:

```bash
if [[ `uname` == "Adam" ]]; then
  echo "Do not eat an apple!"
elif [[ `uname` == "Eva" ]]; then
  echo "Do not take an apple!"
else
  echo "Apples are delicious!"
fi
```

## Using a `case` statement

If you are confronted with a couple of different possible actions to take, then using a `case` statement may be more useful than nested `if` statements. For more complex conditions use `case` like below:

```bash
case "$extension" in
  "jpg"|"jpeg")
    echo "It's image with jpeg extension."
  ;;
  "png")
    echo "It's image with png extension."
  ;;
  "gif")
    echo "Oh, it's a giphy!"
  ;;
  *)
    echo "Woops! It's not image!"
  ;;
esac
```

Each case is an expression matching a pattern. The `|` sign is used for separating multiple patterns, and the `)` operator terminates a pattern list. The commands for the first match are executed. `*` is the pattern for anything else that doesn't match the defined patterns. Each block of commands should be divided with the `;;` operator.

# Loops

Here we won't be surprised. As in any programming language, a loop in bash is a block of code that iterates as long as the control conditional is true.

There are four types of loops in Bash: `for`, `while`, `until` and `select`.

## `for` loop

The `for` is very similar to its sibling in C. It looks like this:

```bash
for arg in elem1 elem2 ... elemN
do
  # statements
done
```

During each pass through the loop, `arg` takes on the value from `elem1` to `elemN`. Values may also be wildcards or [brace expansions](#brace-expansion).

Also, we can write `for` loop in one line, but in this case there needs to be a semicolon before `do`, like below:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done
```

By the way, if `for..in..do` seems a little bit weird to you, you can also write `for` in C-like style such as:

```bash
for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )); do
  echo $i
done
```

`for` is handy when we want to do the same operation over each file in a directory. For example, if we need to move all `.bash` files into the `script` folder and then give them execute permissions, our script would look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for FILE in $HOME/*.bash; do
  mv "$FILE" "${HOME}/scripts"
  chmod +x "${HOME}/scripts/${FILE}"
done
```

## `while` loop

The `while` loop tests a condition and loops over a sequence of commands so long as that condition is _true_. A condition is nothing more than a [primary](#primary-and-combining-expressions) as used in `if..then` conditions. So a `while` loop looks like this:

```bash
while [[ condition ]]
do
  # statements
done
```

Just like in the case of the `for` loop, if we want to write `do` and condition in the same line, then we must use a semicolon before `do`.

A working example might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Squares of numbers from 0 through 9
x=0
while [[ $x -lt 10 ]]; do # value of x is less than 10
  echo $(( x * x ))
  x=$(( x + 1 )) # increase x
done
```

## `until` loop

The `until` loop is the exact opposite of the `while` loop. Like a `while` it checks a test condition, but it keeps looping as long as this condition is _false_:

```bash
until [[ condition ]]; do
  #statements
done
```

## `select` loop

The `select` loop helps us to organize a user menu. It has almost the same syntax as the `for` loop:

```bash
select answer in elem1 elem2 ... elemN
do
  # statements
done
```

The `select` prints all `elem1..elemN` on the screen with their sequence numbers, after that it prompts the user. Usually it looks like `$?` (`PS3` variable). The answer will be saved in `answer`. If `answer` is the number between `1..N`, then `statements` will execute and `select` will go to the next iteration — that's because we should use the `break` statement.

A working example might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PS3="Choose the package manager: "
select ITEM in bower npm gem pip
do
  echo -n "Enter the package name: " && read PACKAGE
  case $ITEM in
    bower) bower install $PACKAGE ;;
    npm)   npm   install $PACKAGE ;;
    gem)   gem   install $PACKAGE ;;
    pip)   pip   install $PACKAGE ;;
  esac
  break # avoid infinite loop
done
```

This example, asks the user what package manager {s,he} would like to use. Then, it will ask what package we want to install and finally proceed to install it.

If we run this, we will get:

```
$ ./my_script
1) bower
2) npm
3) gem
4) pip
Choose the package manager: 2
Enter the package name: bash-handbook
<installing bash-handbook>
```

## Loop control

There are situations when we need to stop a loop before its normal ending or step over an iteration. In these cases, we can use the shell built-in `break` and `continue` statements. Both of these work with every kind of loop.

The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop before its ending. We have already met with it.

The `continue` statement steps over one iteration. We can use it as such:

```bash
for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )); do
  if [[ $(( i % 2 )) -eq 0 ]]; then continue; fi
  echo $i
done
```

If we run the example above, it will print all odd numbers from 0 through 9.

# Functions

In scripts we have the ability to define and call functions. As in any programming language, functions in bash are chunks of code, but there are differences.

In bash, functions are a sequence of commands grouped under a single name, that is the _name_ of the function. Calling a function is the same as calling any other program, you just write the name and the function will be _invoked_.

We can declare our own function this way:

```bash
my_func () {
  # statements
}

my_func # call my_func
```

We must declare functions before we can invoke them.

Functions can take on arguments and return a result — exit code. Arguments, within functions, are treated in the same manner as arguments given to the script in [non-interactive](#non-interactive-mode) mode — using [positional parameters](#positional-parameters). A result code can be _returned_ using the `return` command.

Below is a function that takes a name and returns `0`, indicating successful execution.

```bash
# function with params
greeting () {
  if [[ -n $1 ]]; then
    echo "Hello, $1!"
  else
    echo "Hello, unknown!"
  fi
  return 0
}

greeting Denys  # Hello, Denys!
greeting        # Hello, unknown!
```

We already discussed [exit codes](#exit-codes). The `return` command without any arguments returns the exit code of the last executed command. Above, `return 0` will return a successful exit code. `0`.

## Debugging

The shell gives us tools for debugging scripts. If we want to run a script in debug mode, we use a special option in our script's shebang:

```bash
#!/bin/bash options
```

These options are settings that change shell behavior. The following table is a list of options which might be useful to you:

| Short | Name        | Description                                            |
| :---: | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f`  | noglob      | Disable filename expansion (globbing).                 |
| `-i`  | interactive | Script runs in _interactive_ mode.                     |
| `-n`  | noexec      | Read commands, but don't execute them (syntax check).  |
|       | pipefail    | Make pipelines fail if any commands fail, not just if the final command fail. |
| `-t`  | —           | Exit after first command.                              |
| `-v`  | verbose     | Print each command to `stderr` before executing it.    |
| `-x`  | xtrace      | Print each command and its expanded arguments to `stderr` before executing it. |

For example, we have script with `-x` option such as:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -x

for (( i = 0; i < 3; i++ )); do
  echo $i
done
```

This will print the value of the variables to `stdout` along with other useful information:

```
$ ./my_script
+ (( i = 0 ))
+ (( i < 3 ))
+ echo 0
0
+ (( i++  ))
+ (( i < 3 ))
+ echo 1
1
+ (( i++  ))
+ (( i < 3 ))
+ echo 2
2
+ (( i++  ))
+ (( i < 3 ))
```

Sometimes we need to debug a part of a script. In this case using the `set` command is convenient. This command can enable and disable options. Options are turned on using `-` and turned off using `+`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "xtrace is turned off"
set -x
echo "xtrace is enabled"
set +x
echo "xtrace is turned off again"
```

I hope this small handbook was interesting and helpful. To be honest, I wrote this handbook for myself so as to not forget the bash basics. I tried to write concisely but meaningfully, and I hope you will appreciate that.

This handbook narrates my own experience with Bash. It does not purport to be comprehensive, so if you still want more, please run `man bash` and start there.

Contributions are absolutely welcome and I will be grateful for any corrections or questions you can send my way. For all of that create a new [issue](https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook/issues).

The first line that you will write in bash script files is called `shebang`. This line in any script determines the script's ability to be executed like a standalone executable without typing sh, bash, python, php etc beforehand in the terminal.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

## 2.1. Variables

Creating variables in bash is similar to other languages. There are no data types. A variable in bash can contain a number, a character, a string of characters, etc. You have no need to declare a variable, just assigning a value to its reference will create it.

Example:
```bash
str="hello world"
```

The above line creates a variable `str` and assigns "hello world" to it. The value of variable is retrieved by putting the `$` in the beginning of variable name.

Example:
```bash
echo $str   # hello world
```
## 2.2. Array
Like other languages bash has also arrays. An array is a variable containing multiple values. There's no maximum limit on the size of array. Arrays in bash are zero based. The first element is indexed with element 0. There are several ways for creating arrays in bash which are given below.

Examples:
```bash
array[0]=val
array[1]=val
array[2]=val
array=([2]=val [0]=val [1]=val)
array=(val val val)
```
To display a value at specific index use following syntax:

```bash
${array[i]}     # where i is the index
```

If no index is supplied, array element 0 is assumed. To find out how many values there are in the array use the following syntax:

```bash
${#array[@]}
```

Bash has also support for the ternary conditions. Check some examples below.

```bash
${varname:-word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:+word}    # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null
${varname:offset:length}    # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters
```

## 2.3 String Substitution

Check some of the syntax on how to manipulate strings

```bash
${variable#pattern}         # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable##pattern}        # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%pattern}         # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%%pattern}        # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable/pattern/string}  # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. Only the first match is replaced
${variable//pattern/string} # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. All matches are replaced
${#varname}     # returns the length of the value of the variable as a character string
```

## 2.4. Functions
As in almost any programming language, you can use functions to group pieces of code in a more logical way or practice the divine art of recursion. Declaring a function is just a matter of writing function my_func { my_code }. Calling a function is just like calling another program, you just write its name.

```bash
function name() {
    shell commands
}
```

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
function hello {
   echo world!
}
hello

function say {
    echo $1
}
say "hello world!"
```

When you run the above example the `hello` function will output "world!". The above two functions `hello` and `say` are identical. The main difference is function `say`. This function, prints the first argument it receives. Arguments, within functions, are treated in the same manner as arguments given to the script.

## 2.5. Conditionals

The conditional statement in bash is similar to other programming languages. Conditions have many form like the most basic form is `if` expression `then` statement where statement is only executed if expression is true.

```bash
if [ expression ]; then
    will execute only if expression is true
else
    will execute if expression is false
fi
```

Sometime if conditions becoming confusing so you can write the same condition using the `case statements`.

```bash
case expression in
    pattern1 )
        statements ;;
    pattern2 )
        statements ;;
    ...
esac
```

Expression Examples:

```bash
statement1 && statement2  # both statements are true
statement1 || statement2  # at least one of the statements is true

str1=str2       # str1 matches str2
str1!=str2      # str1 does not match str2
str1<str2       # str1 is less than str2
str1>str2       # str1 is greater than str2
-n str1         # str1 is not null (has length greater than 0)
-z str1         # str1 is null (has length 0)

-a file         # file exists
-d file         # file exists and is a directory
-e file         # file exists; same -a
-f file         # file exists and is a regular file (i.e., not a directory or other special type of file)
-r file         # you have read permission
-s file         # file exists and is not empty
-w file         # you have write permission
-x file         # you have execute permission on file, or directory search permission if it is a directory
-N file         # file was modified since it was last read
-O file         # you own file
-G file         # file's group ID matches yours (or one of yours, if you are in multiple groups)

file1 -nt file2     # file1 is newer than file2
file1 -ot file2     # file1 is older than file2

-lt     # less than
-le     # less than or equal
-eq     # equal
-ge     # greater than or equal
-gt     # greater than
-ne     # not equal
```

## 2.6. Loops

There are three types of loops in bash. `for`, `while` and `until`.

Different `for` Syntax:
```bash
for x := 1 to 10 do
begin
  statements
end

for name [in list]
do
  statements that can use $name
done

for (( initialisation ; ending condition ; update ))
do
  statements...
done
```

`while` Syntax:
```bash
while condition; do
  statements
done
```

`until` Syntax:
```bash
until condition; do
  statements
done
```

# 3. Tricks

## Set an alias

Run `nano ~/.bash_profile` and add the following line:

```bash
alias dockerlogin='ssh www-data@adnan.local -p2222'  # add your alias in .bash_profile
```

## To quickly go to a specific directory

Run `nano ~/.bashrc` and add the following line:

```bash
export hotellogs="/workspace/hotel-api/storage/logs"
```

Now you can use the saved path:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
cd $hotellogs
```

## Re-execute the previous command

This goes back to the days before you could rely on keyboards to have an "up" arrow key, but can still be useful. 
To run the last command in your history
```bash
!!
```
A common error is to forget to use `sudo` to prefix a command requiring privileged execution. Instead of typing the whole command again, you can:
```bash
sudo !!
```
This would change a `mkdir somedir` into `sudo mkdir somedir`.

## Exit traps

Make your bash scripts more robust by reliably performing cleanup.

```bash
function finish {
  # your cleanup here. e.g. kill any forked processes
  jobs -p | xargs kill
}
trap finish EXIT
```

## Saving your environment variables

When you do `export FOO = BAR`, your variable is only exported in this current shell and all its children, to persist in the future you can simply append in your `~/.bash_profile` file the command to export your variable
```bash
echo export FOO=BAR >> ~/.bash_profile
```

## Accessing your scripts

You can easily access your scripts by creating a bin folder in your home with `mkdir ~/bin`, now all the scripts you put in this folder you can access in any directory.

If you can not access, try append the code below in your `~/.bash_profile` file and after do `source ~/.bash_profile`.
```bash
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

# 4. Debugging
You can easily debug the bash script by passing different options to `bash` command. For example `-n` will not run commands and check for syntax errors only. `-v` echo commands before running them. `-x` echo commands after command-line processing.

```bash
bash -n scriptname
bash -v scriptname
bash -x scriptname
```
